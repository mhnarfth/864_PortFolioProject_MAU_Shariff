A productive and precise air quality index (AQI) is a must and one of the obligatory conditions for helping the society to be viable in lieu of the consequences of air contamination. If we know the index of air quality in advance, then it would be of a great help saving our health from air contamination. This study introduces an air quality index prediction model for two mostly polluted cities in Bangladesh: Dhaka and Chattogram. Gated recurrent unit (GRU), long short-term memory (LSTM) are the two robust variation of recurrent neural network (RNN). This model combines these two together. We have used GRU as first hidden layer and LSTM as the second hidden layer of the model, followed by two dense layers. After collecting and processing the data, the model was trained on 80% of the data and then validated against the remaining data. We have evaluated the performance of the model considering MSE, RMSE, and MAE to see how much error does the model produce. Results reflect that our model can follow the actual AQI trends for both cities. At last, we have juxtaposed the performance of our proposed hybrid model against a standalone GRU model and a standalone LSTM model. Results also show that combining these two models improves the overall model’s performance.\"},{\"id\":\"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDU0NjcyNzQ=\",\"url\":\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IvO9Ap-qoR4u4GEYirZSu9sUjGBpEhvt/view?usp=sharing\",\"name\":\"A Comparative Study of Big Data Visualization Tools and Techniques\",\"createdAt\":\"[to be published on next month]\",\"publishedIn\":\"N/A\",\"publisher\":\"Taylor & Francis\",\"abstract\":\"We are living in an age where everything is getting recorded digitally, thanks to the rise of the Internet and Social Media. Exabytes of data are getting generated frequently which needs to be explored, cleansed and analysed to make them usable. Big data is a term that represents a huge volume of structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data. Translating information into meaningful visual context such as graphs, maps or charts to make data easier as well as pulling insights are called Data visualization. It also introduces numerous possibilities for solving the big-data problem by creative ideation through visual means. Lots of challenges as well as problems are associated with big data analysis due to its complex characteristics. In this article, we’ll discuss about the reasons of big data visualization being necessary, as well as some big data visualization tools. We will also summarize different types of challenges in visualization methods as well as suggest possible way forward for complications pertaining to the visualization of Big Data. In addition, the working procedure, characteristics, and drawbacks of several tools and techniques for big data visualization are examined in our research.\"},{\"id\":\"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDU0NjcyNzQ=\",\"url\":\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WhTagumtEyfUz570pnsT2D-eN3l9UcAL/view?usp=sharing\",\"name\":\"A Bangladeshi Regional Dialects Identification using a Novel GLDNN Hybrid Model\",\"createdAt\":\"Mar 2021\",\"publishedIn\":\"Dissertation Book\",\"publisher\":\"Undergraduate Thesis\",\"abstract\":\"Dialect recognition is an area of linguistic recognition science. In speech processing, automatic recognition systems are used effectively to categorize observed utterances by the speaker's identity, dialect, and linguistic communication. The dialect of the speaker can reduce automatic speech recognition systems efficiency. Dialects can affect the recognition of the voice because they influence intonation and syllable pronunciation. The characteristics of each tribe and area reflect in each dialect. There has been a significant amount of investigation to detect speeches, dialects, and tongues of various regions worldwide. However, the research is not popular to work on Bangladeshi dialects. In turn, these dialects vary considerably. This work is an effort to meet the needs of new languages which have not received enough resources. The recognition scheme will serve the benefit and interest of Bangladeshi-speakers and helps to keep the dialects of the language preserved. Speech samples are obtained to create a database that contains dialects of various ages and genders. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients as features derived from the database. The dialects under consideration are Barisali, Brahmanbaria, Chittagonian, Chapainawabganj, Noakhali & Sylheti. This paper aims to build a speech-recognition System with Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients that is fed into a Neural Network based hybrid system (GLDNN) consists of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Neural Network to distinguish those specific dialects. Results indicate that the system outperforms the preceding system.\"}]};// Contact Page\nvar contactPageData={contactSection:{title:\"Contact Me\",profile_image_path:\"mahin-arafath-500-500.png\",description:\"I am available on almost every social media.

A productive and precise air quality index (AQI) is a must and one of the obligatory conditions for helping the society to be viable in lieu of the consequences of air contamination. If we know the index of air quality in advance, then it would be of a great help saving our health from air contamination. This study introduces an air quality index prediction model for two mostly polluted cities in Bangladesh: Dhaka and Chattogram. Gated recurrent unit (GRU), long short-term memory (LSTM) are the two robust variation of recurrent neural network (RNN). This model combines these two together. We have used GRU as first hidden layer and LSTM as the second hidden layer of the model, followed by two dense layers. After collecting and processing the data, the model was trained on 80% of the data and then validated against the remaining data. We have evaluated the performance of the model considering MSE, RMSE, and MAE to see how much error does the model produce. Results reflect that our model can follow the actual AQI trends for both cities. At last, we have juxtaposed the performance of our proposed hybrid model against a standalone GRU model and a standalone LSTM model. Results also show that combining these two models improves the overall model’s performance.\"\n      },\n      {\n        \"id\": \"MDEwOlJlcG9zaXRvcnkyNDU0NjcyNzQ=\",\n        \"url\": \"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IvO9Ap-qoR4u4GEYirZSu9sUjGBpEhvt/view?usp=sharing\",\n        \"name\": \"A Comparative Study of Big Data Visualization Tools and Techniques\",\n        \"createdAt\": \"[to be published on next month]\",\n        \"publishedIn\" : \"N/A\",\n        \"publisher\" : \"Taylor & Francis\",\n        \"abstract\": \"We are living in an age where everything is getting recorded digitally, thanks to the rise of the Internet and Social Media.

In speech processing, automatic recognition systems are used effectively to categorize observed utterances by the speaker's identity, dialect, and linguistic communication. The dialect of the speaker can reduce automatic speech recognition systems efficiency. Dialects can affect the recognition of the voice because they influence intonation and syllable pronunciation. The characteristics of each tribe and area reflect in each dialect. There has been a significant amount of investigation to detect speeches, dialects, and tongues of various regions worldwide. However, the research is not popular to work on Bangladeshi dialects. In turn, these dialects vary considerably. This work is an effort to meet the needs of new languages which have not received enough resources. The recognition scheme will serve the benefit and interest of Bangladeshi-speakers and helps to keep the dialects of the language preserved. Speech samples are obtained to create a database that contains dialects of various ages and genders. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients as features derived from the database. The dialects under consideration are Barisali, Brahmanbaria, Chittagonian, Chapainawabganj, Noakhali & Sylheti. This paper aims to build a speech-recognition System with Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients that is fed into a Neural Network based hybrid system (GLDNN) consists of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), and Deep Neural Network to distinguish those specific dialects.
